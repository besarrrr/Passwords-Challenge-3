# Random Password Generator

The task is to take  the existing code to set-up a mock password generator and make it functional. The starter code received included working HTML and CSS docs but had a JAVASCRIPT doc that was not working correctly. The goal was to make the password generator work while adhering to the criteria wanted by the end user.To do this, the interface needed to become responsive. To work on this I have updated the JAVASCRIPT and made it so that a user can generate a password that is at least 8 characters long but not longer than 128, and could have any combination of four types of characters: uppercase letters,lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. 

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need a new, secure password<br />
WHEN I click the button to generate a password<br />
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria<br />
WHEN prompted for password criteria<br />
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password<br />
WHEN prompted for the length of the password<br />
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters<br />
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password<br />
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters<br />
WHEN I answer each prompt<br />
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected<br />
WHEN all prompts are answered<br />
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria<br />
WHEN the password is generated<br />
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page<br />

## What, Why, How

### What:
The goal was to refactor the existing code to get it to generate a random password in an interactive manner. 

### Why:
I was motivated to apply the JAVASCRIPT concepts that I have learned thus far and grow in my understanding of the language. I learn best while doing and by trial and error. This allowed for both. 

### How:
To complete this task I  relied on a few different sources of information. I used example code worked on  in my UT Austin Coding Bootcamp classes, modules, and office hours. When in a particularly hard spot I use Google as my best friend since coding web pages online hold a wealth of information. Combined this provided a framework from which I could work from and could find answers to any areas that may have caused some difficulties.
